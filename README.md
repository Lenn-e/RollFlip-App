# RollFlip

Welcome to RollFlip, a Dymension rollapp that lets you challenge others to a game of coinflip. Here, you and another person bet an equal amount of native currency - RLFP, and the winner takes it all!

## A Word of Caution
This is an early version of RollFlip, and while we've done our best to ensure everything runs smoothly, there might still be a few bugs lurking around!

## Future Plans
We're constantly working to improve RollFlip. In future versions, we plan to implement a more secure robust method for determining the winner as well as more features like leaderboards and solo play. Stay tuned for updates.
